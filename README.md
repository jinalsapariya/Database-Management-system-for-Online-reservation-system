# Database Management system for Online reservation system

For this project I have conceptualized an online reservation and ordering system that allows users to reserve tables at restaurants, order food from restaurants, book appointments at events and get tickets for concerts. I have designed scripts that creates a database management system for this portal and inserts data into it. I have also written some stored procedures to analyse the data in the system and get more insights using SQL.


The following ER diagram explains the architecture of the whole database.
